# Searching

A search algorithm is a method for finding an item or group of items with specific properties within a collection of items. The items in the collection can be thought of as being stored in an array or list, and the process of searching for an item can be thought of as comparing the item with each item in the collection until a match is found.

The set of items can be already sorted or unsorted.
