# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. Stacks stores data in a specific order similar to arrays or linked lists with some constraints.

- **Push**: Add an element only to the top of a stack
- **Pop**: Remove an element only from the top of a stack
- **Peek**: Get the top element of the stack without removing it

The operations in a stack are performed through a pointer named `top`.
Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The array implementation is simple and easy to implement, but it has a fixed size. The linked list implementation is dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed, but it requires more memory and time to manage the pointers.
