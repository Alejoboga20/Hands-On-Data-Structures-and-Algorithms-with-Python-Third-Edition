# Graphs and Algorithms

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. A graph can be directed or undirected, and it can be weighted or unweighted. Graphs are used to model many real-world systems, such as computer networks, social networks, transportation networks, and more.

Math Expresion: `G = (V, E)`. It's a formal mathematical representation of a graph, where `V` is the set of vertices and `E` is the set of edges.
